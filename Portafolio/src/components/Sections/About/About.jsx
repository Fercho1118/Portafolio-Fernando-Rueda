          <p>
            Hi! I'm Fernando Rueda, a third-year Computer Science and Information Technology student at Universidad del Valle de Guatemala.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm passionate about web development, especially building backend services and APIs that are scalable and efficient. Iâ€™m also deeply interested in Artificial Intelligence, particularly in the areas of Large Language Models (LLMs) and how they are transforming the future of software and human-computer interaction.
            I'm constantly learning and experimenting with new tools and technologies, and I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to think critically and build creative solutions.
            Currently looking for opportunities to grow professionally and contribute to real-world software development teams.
          </p>
